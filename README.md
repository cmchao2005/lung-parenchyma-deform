Lung model actual.mp4 and lung model.mp4 are based on Birzle's poroelastic model, while others are based on hyperelasticity-only models (the Neo-Hookean and Holmes-Mow models).

hyperelastic-only models, such as the Neo-Hookean and Holmes-Mow models, produce irregular surface deformations. In contrast, Birzle's poroelastic model generates smoother, 
more regular surface deformations, offering a significantly more realistic representation of lung behavior. This highlights the enhanced relevance of poroelastic models 
in advancing finite element method (FEM) simulations for respiratory biomechanics.

From the comparisons, it is clear that the hyperelasticity-only models did not give reasonable simulations, while Birzle's poroelastic model gives more accurate simulations that 
mimic biophysical process.
